Computers are some of the most versatile tools that we have available. They are capable of performing stunning feats of computation
they allow information to be exchanged easily regardless of their physical location, they simplify many every-day tasks
and they allow us to automate many processes that would be tedious or boring to perform otherwise. However, computers are not intelligent
as we are. 
They have to be told in no uncertain terms exactly what they're supposed to do, and their native languages are quite unlike anything we speak. 
Thus, there's a formidable language barrier between a person who wishes a computer to do something, and the computer that typically 
requires instructions in its native language, machine code, to do anything. So far, computers cannot figure out what they are supposed to do on their own
and thus they rely on programs which we create, which are sets of instructions that the computer can understand and follow.
